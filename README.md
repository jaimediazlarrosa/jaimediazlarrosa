- 👋 Hi, I’m @jaimediazlarrosa, a PhD student in the Epigenetics Division of the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) 
- 🦞 I’m interested in developing and adapting different bioinformatical tools to our new model organism, the Marbled Crayfish 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code generally with classical bioinformatics tools, mainly, R and python 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different projects and make the most out of our model organism, so if you have any idea, please reach me so that can work together!!
